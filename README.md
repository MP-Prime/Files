# **Note Project**
## _Repository that stores the note project_
---
### **Summary**
In this project, I will attempt to create a service that can be used to take notes or, more generally, write. The uniqueness of this particular project is that it will store different versions that the users can refer back to. This will allow them to recover and restart from a point that they left off from a few days ago.
